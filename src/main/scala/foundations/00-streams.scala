/**
 * STREAMS
 *
 * The raison d'etre of streams is their ability to do _incremental
 * computation_.  Ordinarily, functions instantly compute their
 * singular result. The stream paradigm, however, allows streams to
 * produce results incrementally.
 *
 * Importantly for modern applications, which process never-ending
 * amounts of data (events, requests, etc.), proper streaming toolkits
 * allow us to incrementally perform computation over infinite streams
 * of data, in bounded memory, without resource leaks, and with the
 * right degree of concurrency for every job.
 *
 * There are many streaming libraries in Scala, including Akka Streams,
 * FS2, ZIO Streams, etc. This course will teach you the foundations
 * that underpin these libraries and other libraries in other
 * ecosystems. By the time you are done with this workshop, you will
 * have generic knowledge about the nature of streaming that will
 * enable to you use and be proficient with any streaming library.

/**
 * STREAMS
 *
 * The requirement that streams be able to operate on unbounded amounts of
 * ddata means that streams must be lazy. In turn, laziness means that the
 * interface of a stream cannot be exactly like that of a Scala collection.
 * That said, most collection methods have an equivalent in the world of
 * streaming.
 *
 * In this section, you will explore streams as a "lazy version of List",
 * which is the simplest possible mental model, and allows you to leverage
 * your knowledge of Scala collections to understand streams.
